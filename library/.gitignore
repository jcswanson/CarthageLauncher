# This is the main build script for our project.
# It contains commands to compile, test, and package our code.

# First, let's install any necessary dependencies.
# We use the 'npm install' command to install Node.js packages.
npm install --quiet

# Next, we compile our TypeScript code into JavaScript.
# We use the 'tsc' command to compile all .ts files in the 'src' directory.
tsc || exit 1

# After compiling our code, we run our unit tests.
# We use the 'npm test' command to run tests defined in our 'package.json' file.
npm test || exit 1

# If our tests pass, we package our code for distribution.
# We use the 'npm run package' command to create a .tar.gz file in the 'dist' directory.
npm test && npm run package || exit 1
