# This is the main build script for our project.
# It contains commands to compile, test, and package our code.

# First, we clean any previous build artifacts to ensure a fresh build.
clean:
	rm -f *.class

# Next, we compile the Java source code into bytecode.
compile:
	javac -d . *.java

# After compiling, we run tests to ensure everything works as expected.
test:
	java -cp .:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass

# Finally, we package the compiled code and dependencies into a JAR file.
package:
	jar cvfm myproject.jar manifest.mf *.class
