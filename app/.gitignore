# This script is responsible for building and packaging the application for distribution.
# It performs the following tasks:
# 1. Compiles the source code and generates executable files.
# 2. Runs any necessary tests to ensure the application is functioning correctly.
# 3. Generates documentation for the application.
# 4. Packages the application into a distributable format (e.g. .deb, .rpm, .zip, etc.)
# 5. Publishes the distributable package to a designated repository or distribution channel.
#
# Before running this script, ensure that all dependencies have been installed and are up-to-date.
# To run the script, simply execute the following command:
#   $ ./build
#
# If the build is successful, the distributable package will be located in the "dist" directory.
