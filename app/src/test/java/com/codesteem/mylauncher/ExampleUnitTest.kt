/**
 * This class, `ExampleUnitTest`, contains a single example local unit test which will execute on the development machine (host). 
 *
 * The purpose of this test is to verify that the addition function is working correctly. Specifically, it checks that the sum of 2 + 2 is equal to 4.
 *
 * Unit tests are an important part of the development process, as they help ensure that individual components of the code are functioning correctly.
 * By writing tests for specific functionality, developers can catch and fix bugs early on, reducing the overall complexity and maintenance of the codebase.
 *
 * For more information on unit testing in Android, please refer to the official documentation:
 * [testing documentation](http://d.android.com/tools/testing).
