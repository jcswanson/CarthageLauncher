/**
 * This class, `ExampleUnitTest`, contains a single example local unit test which will execute on the development machine (host). 
 *
 * The purpose of this test is to verify that the addition function produces the correct output. Specifically, it checks that the sum of two and two equals four.
 *
 * Unit tests are an important part of the development process, as they allow developers to catch and fix bugs early on. By writing tests for individual units of code, we can ensure that each component is functioning correctly and working together as expected.
 *
 * For more information on unit testing in Android, please refer to the [official documentation](http://d.android.com/tools/testing).
