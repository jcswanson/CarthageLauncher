# IGNORED FILES
# The following lines define a list of files or directories that should be ignored by version control systems or other tools.
# This can help to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from being accidentally included in a codebase.

# The first line specifies the '/shelf/' directory as an ignored file. This directory may contain temporary or intermediate files generated by certain software tools.
/shelf/

# The second line specifies the '/workspace.xml' file as an ignored file. This file may contain user-specific settings or preferences that should not be shared or checked into version control.
/workspace.xml
